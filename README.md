## About

The **Hulstrom Demon List** is a competitive ranking platform for the hardest levels on the Hulstrom version of Geometry Dash.

Inspired by platforms such as Pointercrate.net and AREDL.net.

## How It Works

### Level Placement
- Levels are reviewed and ranked based on difficulty.
- Placement is determined through testing and player input.
- When a new level is verified, it is evaluated and placed accordingly.
- Rankings update as new levels enter the list.

### Submission Review Process
All submissions are manually reviewed by me.
